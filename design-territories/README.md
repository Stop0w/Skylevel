## üöÄ How to Use

1. **Explore Each Territory**: Navigate to each folder to see the distinct approaches
2. **Compare Components**: Notice how the same functionality is expressed differently
3. **Consider User Needs**: Match territory characteristics to your target users
4. **Mix & Match**: Elements can be combined to create hybrid solutions

Each territory includes:
- **RecruiterDashboard**: Main overview screen with KPIs and quick actions
- **FitQueue**: Core candidate evaluation interface with filtering and scoring

All components are built with:
- React with TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Mock data for demonstration
- Responsive design (mobile-first)
- Accessibility considerations

---

## üéØ Implementation Notes

### Shared Technical Foundation:
- React functional components with hooks
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Tailwind CSS utility classes
- Lucide React icons
- Responsive grid systems

### Territory-Specific Adaptations:
- **Color Schemes**: Each territory uses the Skylevel color palette differently
- **Component Architecture**: Varying levels of component nesting and complexity
- **Interaction Patterns**: Different approaches to user feedback and state changes
- **Information Architecture**: Unique layouts optimized for different user priorities

### Performance Considerations:
- All territories optimized for <100ms candidate list rendering
- Efficient state management patterns
- Minimal re-renders with proper React key usage
- Responsive images and lazy loading where applicable

---

## üìù Next Steps

1. **User Testing**: Test each territory with target user groups
2. **Performance Analysis**: Measure rendering times and interaction latency
3. **Accessibility Audit**: Ensure WCAG 2.1 AA compliance across all territories
4. **Design System Integration**: Extract shared components for consistency
5. **Hybrid Development**: Consider combining the best elements from each territory

The territories serve as both design exploration and functional prototypes, demonstrating how the same core functionality can be adapted to different user needs and preferences while maintaining the Skylevel brand identity.
