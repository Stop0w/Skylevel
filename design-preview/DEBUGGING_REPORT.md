# Design Territories Debugging Report

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. **Primary Issue: PostCSS Configuration**
**Problem**: The application was using the wrong PostCSS plugin for Tailwind CSS v4.

**Details**:
- Using `tailwindcss: {}` in PostCSS config
- Tailwind CSS v4 requires `@tailwindcss/postcss: {}` plugin
- This prevented Tailwind classes from being generated properly

**Fix Applied**:
```javascript
// postcss.config.js (BEFORE)
export default {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}

// postcss.config.js (AFTER)
export default {
  plugins: {
    '@tailwindcss/postcss': {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

### 2. **Error Handling Implementation**
**Problem**: No error boundary to catch and display React errors.

**Fix Applied**:
- Created `ErrorBoundary` component (`src/components/ErrorBoundary.tsx`)
- Updated `main.tsx` to wrap the app with error boundary
- Added comprehensive error logging

### 3. **CSS Build Verification**
**Problem**: Uncertain if CSS was being processed correctly.

**Verification Steps**:
- Confirmed Tailwind CSS v4.1.14 is properly processing
- Verified all custom Skylevel brand colors are available:
  - `primary-600: #8B1538` (Skylevel brand red)
  - `accent-400: #D4AF37` (Skylevel gold)
  - `neutral-950: #0A0606` (Skylevel background)
  - `neutral-50: #F5F2E8` (Skylevel text)

### 4. **Component Structure Verification**
**Status**: ✅ All components properly implemented
- `TerritoryA-Dashboard.tsx` - Confident Clarity design
- `TerritoryA-FitQueue.tsx` - Confident Clarity Fit Queue
- `TerritoryB-Dashboard.tsx` - Thoughtful & Calm design
- `TerritoryB-FitQueue.tsx` - Thoughtful & Calm Fit Queue
