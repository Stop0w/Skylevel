## Presentation Structure (18 Slides)

### **Slide 1: Cover**
**Visual**: Skylevel logo + tagline  
**Content**:
- **Skylevel**: The Intelligence Layer for Hiring
- *Start Every Hire with Proof, Not Guesswork*
- Seed Round | $2-5M | January 2025

---

### **Slide 2: The Problem (The $300B Hiring Failure)**
**Visual**: Split screen - chaos vs. clarity

**Content**:
- **The Reality**: Companies spend $300B/year on hiring
- **The Failure**: 70% of hires don't meet performance expectations
- **The Root Cause**: Decisions based on resumes + gut feelings, not proof

**Key Stat (Center)**: 
> "It takes 6 months and $50K to realize a bad hire"

**Visual Evidence**: 
- Left: Stack of 200 resumes (overwhelm)
- Right: Hiring manager with question marks (uncertainty)

---

### **Slide 3: Why This Happens**
**Visual**: Three pain points with icons

**Content**:
1. **Volume Paralysis**: 200 applications → Can't process signal from noise
2. **Resume Deception**: 40% of resumes contain false claims (Source: HireRight)
3. **Network Blind Spots**: Best candidates come through referrals, but hiring managers don't have the network

**Bottom Line**: 
*"Recruiters are flying blind with billions at stake"*

---

### **Slide 4: Current "Solutions" Are Broken**
**Visual**: Graveyard of failed tools

**Content**:
| Tool | Promise | Reality |
|------|---------|---------|
| **ATS Systems** | "Organize candidates" | Digital filing cabinet—still no signal |
| **AI Resume Screeners** | "Smart filtering" | Keyword matching—miss the best talent |
| **Sourcing Platforms** | "Find talent" | More volume—same problem |

**Key Insight**:
> "The market has organizing tools. Nobody has a **truth layer**."

---

### **Slide 5: The Skylevel Solution**
**Visual**: Before/After transformation

**Content**:
**Before Skylevel**:
- 200 resumes → Weeks of review → Gut-feel decision → 70% failure rate

**After Skylevel**:
- 200 applicants → **Fit Scores** (validated by referral network) → Top 5 surfaced → Interview best candidates first

**The Breakthrough**: 
*We synthesize candidate volume through validated Fit Scores to surface proven talent in minutes*

---

### **Slide 6: How It Works (3-Step System)**
**Visual**: Flow diagram with animations

**Content**:
1. **JobPrint™**: Hiring manager calibrates role requirements (2 minutes)
2. **Fit Score Engine**: Candidate submits application → AI calculates match → Referral network validates
3. **Ranked Queue**: Top candidates (85+) auto-surface to recruiter's Fit Queue

**The Magic**: 
- Candidate gets instant Fit Score (78/100)
- Recruiter sees validated proof, not resumes
- Referrers earn commission for quality referrals

---

### **Slide 7: The Fit Score Algorithm**
**Visual**: Score breakdown with weighted components

**Content**:
**Fit Score = Validated Intelligence**

```
Experience Match: 40%
Skill Alignment: 30%
Referral Network Score (RNS): 20%
Cultural + Domain Signals: 10%
```

**Key Differentiator**: 
- **RNS (Referral Network Score)**: Peer validation from candidate's professional network
- If RNS < 50 → Flag "Trust Threshold" → Manual review
- If RNS > 75 → "Network Validated" → Fast-track

**Bottom Line**: 
*"We don't just score candidates. We validate them."*

---

### **Slide 8: Market Size**
**Visual**: TAM/SAM/SOM funnel

**Content**:
- **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**: $300B global recruiting spend
- **SAM (Serviceable Market)**: $120B (US + UK + AU white-collar hiring)
- **SOM (Target - Year 3)**: $2.4B (2% of SAM)

**Breakdown**:
- 500K recruiters in US
- Average 30 hires/year/recruiter
- $500/hire Skylevel value capture
- **Year 1 Target**: 5,000 recruiters = $75M ARR potential

---

### **Slide 9: Business Model (Triple Revenue)**
**Visual**: Three revenue streams

**Content**:
1. **SaaS Subscription** (Primary - 70% revenue)
   - $499/month per recruiter seat
   - Unlimited job posts + candidate Fit Scores
   - Team collaboration tools

2. **Marketplace Commission** (Growth - 25% revenue)
   - Referrers earn 5-15% of first-year salary
   - Skylevel takes 20% platform fee
   - Example: $100K hire → $10K referral fee → $2K to Skylevel

3. **Enterprise Licensing** (Future - 5% revenue)
   - White-label for Fortune 500
   - API integrations with ATS (Greenhouse, Lever)
   - Custom Fit Score models

**Unit Economics**:
- CAC: $800 (paid ads + sales)
- LTV: $18K (3-year avg retention at $500/mo)
- **LTV:CAC = 22.5:1**

---

### **Slide 10: Go-to-Market Strategy**
**Visual**: Three-phase rollout

**Content**:
**Phase 1: Niche Domination (Months 1-6)**
- Target: Tech recruiters in SF/NYC/Austin
- Tactic: Referral program (recruiter refers recruiter = 3 months free)
- Goal: 500 paying recruiters

**Phase 2: Category Expansion (Months 7-12)**
- Expand to: Finance, Healthcare, Legal recruiters
- Tactic: Case studies + performance marketing
- Goal: 2,000 paying recruiters

**Phase 3: Enterprise Land-and-Expand (Year 2)**
- Target: Fortune 500 HR departments
- Tactic: Pilot programs → Full rollout
- Goal: 10 enterprise contracts

**Key Insight**: 
*"We're not selling software. We're selling certainty in hiring."*

### **Slide 11: Competitive Landscape**
**Visual**: 2x2 matrix (Intelligence vs. Volume)

**Content**:
|  | **High Volume** | **Selective** |
|---|---|---|
| **Low Intelligence** | LinkedIn Recruiter, Indeed | Traditional headhunters |
| **High Intelligence** | **← SKYLEVEL** | Executive search firms |

**Key Differentiator**:
- **LinkedIn**: Sourcing tool (no validation)
- **Greenhouse/Lever**: ATS (organizes, doesn't score)
- **AI Resume Screeners**: Keyword matching (no network proof)
- **Skylevel**: Intelligence + validation layer

**Moat**: 
- Network effects (more referrers = better Fit Scores)
- Proprietary Fit Score algorithm
- Data flywheel (more hires = smarter model)

## Presentation Delivery Tips

### **Timing** (15-minute pitch):
- Slides 1-5: Problem (3 min)
- Slides 6-8: Solution + Market (3 min)
- Slides 9-11: Business Model + Competition (3 min)
- Slides 12-15: Traction + Team + Financials (4 min)
- Slides 16-18: Ask + Close (2 min)

### **Key Messaging**:
1. **Hook**: "$300B hiring industry, 70% failure rate—we're fixing it"
2. **Insight**: "Resumes lie. Networks don't."
3. **Proof**: "89% of our 85+ Fit Scores advance to interview"
4. **Moat**: "Network effects + data flywheel = defensibility"
5. **Ask**: "$3M to prove we can dominate tech recruiting, then expand"

### **Objection Handling**:

**Q: "How is this different from LinkedIn Recruiter?"**  
A: "LinkedIn finds candidates. We validate them. They're a sourcing tool. We're an intelligence layer."

**Q: "What about bias in AI?"**  
A: "Our Bias Audit tool actively monitors for disparities. Plus, RNS (network validation) reduces resume-based bias."

**Q: "Why won't ATS companies build this?"**  
A: "They tried. ATSs organize candidates—that's their DNA. We score and validate—fundamentally different product."

**Q: "How do you scale the referral network?"**  
A: "Viral loop: Every hired candidate becomes a potential referrer for future roles. Network grows exponentially."
